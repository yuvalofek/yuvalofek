### Hello there, I'm Yuval ðŸ‘‹

I am a problem solver at heart and am always on the lookout for interesting problems and even more interesting/elegant solutions. As an engineer by schooling, I made the transition to the data field after falling in love with data-driven modeling, reasoning, and decision making. 

I am a data scientist at Morgan Stanley focusing on NLP and helping research new tools and practices to generate $\alpha$. I got my master's from [The Cooper Union](http://cooper.edu/welcome) ([see coursework](https://github.com/yuvalofek/yuvalofek/blob/main/coursework.md)), where I worked on a [augmenting satellite imagery streams through cross-sensor, past, and future assisted deep-learning-based image synthesis](https://github.com/yuvalofek/HSHT-Satellite-Imagery-Synthesis) (synthesizing high resolution satellite images at un-imaged times by levaraging past/future imagery and a 2nd satellite looking at the same location). 

I get excited about learning new things, cooking/food, and the potential of data.

### Current Work:
Learning to learn outside of the schooling system and focusing on becoming a more well-rounded, thoughtful person. 

> School was great for me, but it also only exposed me to very niche information and ideas. After graduating and pushing to continue down a similar route to my education, I felt myself growing complacent. It felt too comfortable. I was going deeper and deeper into known territory and confirming my understandings. I was going nowhere. I am now pushing to do differently - to challenge my comfort zone with what I learn, to re-consider my ideas and beliefs, and to work on being more thoughtful and openminded.

### Some of my favorite work:
* :scroll: **[30DaysOfCode October 2021+](https://github.com/yuvalofek/30DaysOfCode) (Data skills, Machine Learning, Visualization, Coding Fundementals)** - Documented daily progress and worked through personal projects.

* :artificial_satellite: **[S.P.P.P.A.C.Y.](https://github.com/yuvalofek/SPACY) (Deep Learning, Feature Engineering, Data Collection, Data Wrangling, Visualization)** - Full stack data science project to take satellite imagery and predict crop-yield on a per-pixel basis without being biased by current land usage [\[Final Presentation\]](https://www.slideshare.net/secret/NsCczeamHp8A9Z) [\[Report\]](https://github.com/yuvalofek/SPPPACY/blob/master/ECE471_Final_Paper.pdf).

* :chart_with_upwards_trend: **[Data Science for Social Good](https://ee.cooper.edu/~keene/dssgOverview.html) (Data Exploration, Data Modeling, Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Visualization)** - Volunteer work to interpret data and increase costumer retention. The analysis we performed helped the team redesign their intake surveys and got the upper management to hire full-time data scientists!

* :dancer: **[DanceMuse](https://tinydance.github.io/) (Automation, Data Pipelines, Audio Manipulation, Pose Extraction, Dance Generation, Deep Learning)** - Increased the ease of use of dance-generation deep learning models so they can be a tool for the artist community [\[Repo\]](https://github.com/tinydance/DanceMuse) [\[Final Presentation\]](https://www.slideshare.net/YuvalEpstainOfek/dance-muse-inspiring-choreography-through-ai-noartists/secret/sobQhXC7s1HQQ0).

* :shield:  **[DefensiveLayer](https://github.com/yuvalofek/DefensiveLayer) (Deep Learning, Adversarial Attacks, Defence Against Adversarial Attacks)** - Investigated intra-network layers as a way to defend against adversarial attacks, turns out they help! (but also reduce accuracy, so this ends up being a tradeoff) [\[Final Presentation\]](https://www.slideshare.net/secret/KU6C3Q9xmioRiU) [\[Report\]](https://github.com/yuvalofek/DefensiveLayer/blob/main/Defending_Against_Adversarial_Attacks_One_Layer_at_a_Time.pdf).

* :moneybag: **[Financial Signal Processing (course)](https://github.com/yuvalofek/Financial-Signal-Processing) (Time-Series Analysis, Monte Carlo Simulations, Stochastic Differential Equations)** - Finance and financial data-based projects using signal processing.
