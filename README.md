### Hello there, I'm Yuval ðŸ‘‹

I am a master's student at [The Cooper Union](http://cooper.edu/welcome) working on a improving flood-mapping machine learning tools by increasing the temporal resolution of satellite imagery. I am fascinated by how we can use data to make the world a better place.

### Current Work:
Finishing up my master's thesis so I can graduate in December! (update: thesis has been defended!) 

### Some of my favorite work:
* **[Wrote or interacted with code every day of October 2021](https://github.com/yuvalofek/30DaysOfCode)**

* :artificial_satellite: **[S.P.P.P.A.C.Y.](https://github.com/yuvalofek/SPACY) (Deep Learning, Feature Engineering, Data Collection, Data Wrangling, Visualization)** - Full stack data science project to take satellite imagery and predict crop-yield on a per-pixel basis without being biased by current land usage [\[Final Presentation\]](https://www.slideshare.net/secret/NsCczeamHp8A9Z) [\[Report\]](https://github.com/yuvalofek/SPPPACY/blob/master/ECE471_Final_Paper.pdf).

* :chart_with_upwards_trend: **[Data Science for Social Good](https://ee.cooper.edu/~keene/dssgOverview.html) (Data Exploration, Data Modeling, Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Visualization)** - Volunteer work to interpret data and increase costumer retention. The analysis we performed helped the team redesign their intake surveys and got the upper management to hire full-time data scientists!

* :dancer: **[DanceMuse](https://tinydance.github.io/) (Automation, Data Pipelines, Audio Manipulation, Pose Extraction, Dance Generation, Deep Learning)** - Year long project dedicated to increasing the ease of use of dance-generation deep learning models so that they can be a tool for the artist community [\[Repo\]](https://github.com/tinydance/DanceMuse) [\[Final Presentation\]](https://www.slideshare.net/YuvalEpstainOfek/dance-muse-inspiring-choreography-through-ai-noartists/secret/sobQhXC7s1HQQ0).

* :shield:  **[DefensiveLayer](https://github.com/yuvalofek/DefensiveLayer) (Deep Learning, Adversarial Attacks, Defence Against Adversarial Attacks)** - An investigation of the use of intra-network layers as a way to defend against adversarial attacks, turns out they help! (but also reduce accuracy, so this ends up being a tradeoff). [\[Final Presentation\]](https://www.slideshare.net/secret/KU6C3Q9xmioRiU) [\[Report\]](https://github.com/yuvalofek/DefensiveLayer/blob/main/Defending_Against_Adversarial_Attacks_One_Layer_at_a_Time.pdf)

* :moneybag: **[Financial Signal Processing (course)](https://github.com/yuvalofek/Financial-Signal-Processing) (Time-Series Analysis, Monte Carlo Simulations, Stochastic Differential Equations)** - A collection of projects dealing with finance and simulating financial data using a lot of really cool signal processing techniques.
