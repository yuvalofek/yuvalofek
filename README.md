# Nice to meet you, I'm Yuval! ðŸ‘‹

I am a masters student at [The Cooper Union](http://cooper.edu/welcome) working on a thesis focusing on applying deep learning frame interpolation and sensor fusion to satellite imagery. 

## Some of my favorite work:
* **[S.P.A.C.Y.](https://github.com/yuvalofek/SPACY) (Tensorflow, tf.data, Google Earth Engine- Python API, Python)** - We designed and made a machine learning algorithm that takes satellite imagery and predicts crop-yield on a pixel-wise basis. The project had us wrestle with lack of sufficient labels (we could only find aggregate yield values per county), as well as with creating a clean costume dataset. What was really cool, in my opinion, was that we used histograms to help generalize the aggregate, county-level, yield labels to any scale input. 

* **[Data Science for Social Good](https://ee.cooper.edu/~keene/dssgOverview.html) (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Scipy, Group-lasso, Seaborn)** - Volunteer work to interpret data and increase costumer retention. We did a lot of data cleaning & feature selection, collaborated with key personnel to define metrics to evaluate program performance, and trained models to predict most useful cohorts to study further (using residual analysis). At the end of our collaboration, the analysis we performed helped the team redesign their intake surveys to track metrics they care about better. 

* **[Digital Image Processing - Super-resolution](https://github.com/yuvalofek/Digital-Image-Processing) (PyTorch, OpenCV)** - An independent study I took on digital image processing. I followed Gonzalez's Digital Image Processing for the theory, jumping to Tekalp's Digital Video Processing for image formation, stereo, and quaternions, and ended with a selection of papers on super-resolution. Implementing LapSRN in PyTorch at the end of the course was really interesting as I was new to the framework and the final results were really nice. 

* **[DefensiveLayer](https://github.com/yuvalofek/DefensiveLayer) (Tensorflow, Foolbox)** - My first try at independent deep-learning based research (and I loved it!). My partner and I decided to investigate the use of intra-network layers as a way to defend against adversarial attacks, turns out they help! (but also reduce accuracy, so this ends up being a tradeoff). 

* **[Financial Signal Processing (course)](https://github.com/yuvalofek/Financial-Signal-Processing) (Markov chains, Monte Carlo Simulations, Stochastic Differential Equations, time-series analysis, ARMA, GARCH)** - A collection of projects dealing with finance but using a lot of really cool techniques. I loved learning about all the cool tools used to model financial data, and even more so loved to code them up myself and learn to use them.
