# Nice to meet you, I'm Yuval! ðŸ‘‹

I am a masters student at [The Cooper Union](http://cooper.edu/welcome) working on a thesis focusing on applying **computer vision** and **digital image processing** practices to  satellite data (a topic which I hope to refine further in the coming months). 

In my free time I enjoy cooking (right now I am particularly enjoying David Thompson's *Thai Food*, Gonzalo GuzmÃ¡n's *Nopalito*, & Martin Morales' *Ceviche*), reading (papers, novels, and occationally breezing through interesting textbooks), and learning new things that may or may not be useful (juggling, pencil twirls, Diablo, etc.).
