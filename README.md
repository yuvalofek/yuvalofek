### Hello there, I'm Yuval ðŸ‘‹


I'm a problem solver at heart, always seeking interesting challenges and elegant solutions. As an engineer turned data scientist, Iâ€™m passionate about using data-driven approaches to tackle complex problems.

Currently, I'm a Sr. Data Scientist II at KKR, where I develop advanced AI models and platforms to drive innovation and impact. I specialize in full-stack developement of AI-driven tools and process automation, with a focus on enhancing operational efficiency and improving investment decisions. Previously, I was a Data Science Associate at Morgan Stanley, where I developed advanced data pipelines, improved model accuracy, and collaborated across teams to leverage cutting-edge AI technologies.

My passion for data science is matched by my drive for continuous learning and exploring new methodologies. I hold a masterâ€™s degree from [The Cooper Union](http://cooper.edu/welcome) ([see coursework](https://github.com/yuvalofek/yuvalofek/blob/main/coursework.md)), where I worked on augmenting satellite imagery through [deep-learning-based synthesis](https://github.com/yuvalofek/HSHT-Satellite-Imagery-Synthesis).

When I'm not diving into data, I'm exploring the world of cooking and always looking for new ways to expand my knowledge.
