# My Projects:
* :scroll: **[30DaysOfCode October 2021+](https://github.com/yuvalofek/30DaysOfCode) (Data skills, Machine Learning, Visualization, Coding Fundementals)** - Documented daily progress and worked through personal projects.

* :artificial_satellite: **[S.P.P.P.A.C.Y.](https://github.com/yuvalofek/SPACY) (Deep Learning, Feature Engineering, Data Collection, Data Wrangling, Visualization)** - Full stack data science project to take satellite imagery and predict crop-yield on a per-pixel basis without being biased by current land usage [\[Final Presentation\]](https://www.slideshare.net/secret/NsCczeamHp8A9Z) [\[Report\]](https://github.com/yuvalofek/SPPPACY/blob/master/ECE471_Final_Paper.pdf).

* :chart_with_upwards_trend: **[Data Science for Social Good](https://ee.cooper.edu/~keene/dssgOverview.html) (Data Exploration, Data Modeling, Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Visualization)** - Volunteer work to interpret data and increase costumer retention. The analysis we performed helped the team redesign their intake surveys and got the upper management to hire full-time data scientists!

* :dancer: **[DanceMuse](https://tinydance.github.io/) (Automation, Data Pipelines, Audio Manipulation, Pose Extraction, Dance Generation, Deep Learning)** - Increased the ease of use of dance-generation deep learning models so they can be a tool for the artist community [\[Repo\]](https://github.com/tinydance/DanceMuse) [\[Final Presentation\]](https://www.slideshare.net/YuvalEpstainOfek/dance-muse-inspiring-choreography-through-ai-noartists/secret/sobQhXC7s1HQQ0).

* :shield:  **[DefensiveLayer](https://github.com/yuvalofek/DefensiveLayer) (Deep Learning, Adversarial Attacks, Defence Against Adversarial Attacks)** - Investigated intra-network layers as a way to defend against adversarial attacks, turns out they help! (but also reduce accuracy, so this ends up being a tradeoff) [\[Final Presentation\]](https://www.slideshare.net/secret/KU6C3Q9xmioRiU) [\[Report\]](https://github.com/yuvalofek/DefensiveLayer/blob/main/Defending_Against_Adversarial_Attacks_One_Layer_at_a_Time.pdf).

* :moneybag: **[Financial Signal Processing (course)](https://github.com/yuvalofek/Financial-Signal-Processing) (Time-Series Analysis, Monte Carlo Simulations, Stochastic Differential Equations)** - Finance and financial data-based projects using signal processing. 

* :link: **[Tif Image Matcher](https://github.com/yuvalofek/tif_matcher) (Automation, Satellite Imagery, Data Tools, Parallelization)** Matches tif images by content when the naming is wrong
* :books: **[Scraping and Analyzing a Light-Novel Dataset](https://github.com/yuvalofek/scraping-light-novel-data) (Scraping, Data Exploration, Data Analysis, Visualization)** - Figured out the best specifications for writing a light novel  
* :joystick: **[Implemented Othello in C++](https://github.com/yuvalofek/othello) (C++, OOP)** - Implemented the Othello board game using C++ and only stdlib imports
* :computer: **[Implementing Xgboost from scratch](https://github.com/yuvalofek/py_xgboost) (Machine Learning, Extreme Gradient Boosted Trees, Visualization)** - Implemented Xgboost using only Python (and a bit of NumPy)
* :thread: **[Multithreading Matrix Multiplication](https://github.com/yuvalofek/MultiprocessingMatMul) (Parallelization, Linear Algebra)** - Compared different multithreading techniques for matrix multiplication
  
* :earth_africa: **[GEE_Downloader](https://github.com/yuvalofek/GEE_Downloader) (Automation, Satellite Imagery, Data Tools)** - CL tool to download Google Earth Engine Imagery by dates
* :framed_picture: **[Digital Image Processing - Super-resolution](https://github.com/yuvalofek/Digital-Image-Processing) (Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Super-Resolution, Signal Processing)** - Independent study of super resolution (implemented [LapSRN](http://vllab.ucmerced.edu/wlai24/LapSRN/))
* :bar_chart:	**[Frequentist Machine Learning Projects](https://github.com/yuvalofek/FrequentistML) (Machine Learning, Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Linear Algebra, Visualization)** - Learned about and worked with machine learning algorithms
* :artificial_satellite: **[Remote Sensing projects](https://github.com/yuvalofek/Remote-Sensing) (Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Data Wrangling, Geo-Spatial Data, Visualization, GIS, Cartography)** - Desiged deep learning tools for remote sesning and conducted analysis of spatial data. 
* :microphone: **[Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/yuvalofek/NLP) (Machine Learning, Document Classification, Parsing, Deep Learning, Sentiment Analysis)** - Implemented machine learning and deep learning models for nlp
* :sound: **[Sound & Space](https://github.com/yuvalofek/Sound_and_Space) (Matlab, Audio Manipulation, Signal Processing)** - Learned about sound and acoustic properties
